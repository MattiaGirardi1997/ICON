Data was recorded by counting number of visits of each bird species to each plant species. The original data format (interaction frequency matrix) has been converted to an edgelist of interaction counts. Of note, pairs with zero interactions have been omitted. As a result, a small subset of birds and plants that were in the original matrix are not present in this dataset (i.e. birds that did not interact with any plants and vice versa). Additionally, only the common names of the bird and plant species are included. For the scientific names (genus and species), please see the original data source (link below). Column 1 is the common name of the bird species; column 2 is the common name of the plant species; column 3 is the number of times the bird was observed to interact with the plant.","Snow BK, Snow DW (1988).
