## Overview

The ICON R package provides easy-to-use and easy-to-access datasets from the Index of COmplex Networks (ICON) database available at the University of Colorado website.
All datasets can be loaded with a single function call and new datasets are being slowly added from ICON at <https://icon.colorado.edu>.

## Installation

To install the ICON package, run the following R code:
```r
# install from CRAN (not yet)

# install dev version with vignettes/tutorials
devtools::install_github("rrrlw/ICON", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Sample code
