## Resubmission details
This is a resubmission. We have fixed the DESCRIPTION file's
Authors@R field, which previously did not use the person function,
but does now. The 2 potential misspellings have been reviewed
by us and are both correct spellings (unconventional capitalization
given the abbreviation, but we follow the database authors'
convention).

## Test environments

* Travis CI (Linux), r-release
* AppVeyor CI (Windows), r-release
